# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis-Dashboard---2024
This project presents a comprehensive Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis Dashboard for 2024, built using Microsoft Excel with advanced visualization techniques that mimic Power BI dashboards. It helps users analyze EV adoption trends, manufacturer distribution, model popularity, and eligibility for clean vehicle programs across the United States.

üí° Key Insights from the Dashboard
Total EVs Tracked: 14.44K
Average Electric Range: 156.09 km
EV Type Breakdown:
BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles): 10K (70%)
PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles): 4,395 (30%)


üìà Visualizations & Analytics
Trend Analysis:
Total Vehicles by Model Year: Rapid growth from 2017, peaking at 37K in 2023, showing sharp adoption acceleration.
Drop in 2024 indicates either partial year data or market saturation.


Geographic Distribution:
Map of the US displaying EV concentration by state.
